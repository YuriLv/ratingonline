# RATING.ONLINE — Decentralized Survey Platform with AI Poll Builder

**RATING.ONLINE** is a Web3 platform for decentralized, transparent, and incentivized voting and surveys.  
Powered by smart contracts (Polygon/Solana), IPFS, AI, and soulbound NFTs.

## 🌐 Overview

RATING.ONLINE solves trust and motivation issues in public surveys and digital democracy by offering:
- ✅ Verifiable voting
- ✅ AI-assisted poll generation
- ✅ Participation rewards (RATE token)
- ✅ Secure identity via soulbound NFTs
